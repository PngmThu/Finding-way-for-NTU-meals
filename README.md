# Finding-way-for-NTU-meals
This project aims to help NTU students to find the way to canteens that meet a certain number of requirements such as kinds of food, prices and distances. First, users click on the map to indicate their current position and then they will be guided directly to the canteen by the route drawn on NTU map whenever they make decision. Data is collected carefully from all canteens in NTU so it is user-friendly to compare prices from different canteens (a concerning matter for students) and the neareast distance if they do not want to go too far for a meal.
